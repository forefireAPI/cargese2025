# Navigating across observations, concepts and models

## Fall school in turbulence

## Carg√®se, Corsica: October 21 - 31, 2025

The school aims to highlight bridges between the various facets of contemporary research on turbulence. from mathematical fluids to experiments, from phenomenology to stochastic physics. It is the second edition of a biennial series of interdisciplinary schools focused on the fundamental aspects of turbulence, encompassing fields such as mathematics, physics, engineering, astronomy, and geophysics.
The [first edition](https://univ-cotedazur.eu/events/turbulence-semester/summer-school) was held in Porquerolles in June 2024.

Mornings will be devoted to minicourses delivered by lecturers from the mathematics and the physics community, organised into three topical bridges seeking to connect:

- Phenomenology and Functional Spaces

- Lagrangian Particles and Eulerian Fields

- Waves and Turbulent Disorders

In the afternoons, participants will be offered to work in small groups on original research projects supervised by guest and local researchers.
