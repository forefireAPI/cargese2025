# Numerical Wildfire and AI Weather2025


**Numerical Wildfire and AI Weather** is a small, high-level scientific workshop bringing together leading experts in weather AI, numerical wildfire forecasting, and fire-atmosphere interactions. The workshop is designed as an **intensive, on-site event**. Unlike large conferences, this **small-group format** allows for extended scientific exchanges, joint project work, and a strong interdisciplinary approach. The goal is to bridge the gap between cutting-edge research and operational needs by focusing on **real-world applications of AI, numerical modeling, and risk assessment**.

## Workshop Registration

To register for the workshop, please submit a short 300m abstract with a **title** and register at the following address:  
ðŸ‘‰ [https://iesc-inscriptions.fr](https://iesc-inscriptions.fr)

For any inquiries, contact: [filippi_j@univ-corse.fr](mailto:filippi_j@univ-corse.fr)

Participants are invited to select one of the two main themes:
- **Weather and AI**
- **Digital simulation of forest fires**

The editorial committee will assign abstracts to one of the two themes. Decisions will be made before October, but **abstracts must be submitted by September 20**.

We are currently accepting registrations for those wishing to participate. There will be an approximate (depending on number of days and accomodation type) **400â‚¬ fee** covering **accommodation and lunch** only, people must be on-site and encouraged to stay for the week.
It is **free for the members of the University of Corsica **.

## Workshop details

The first two days will focus on **wildfire science**, exploring fire-atmosphere interactions, numerical fire spread models, and operational forecasting challenges. Experts will discuss the latest advancements in **fire behavior prediction, risk assessment, and real-time monitoring**.


The next two days will shift towards **AI-driven forecasting of extreme weather events**, with sessions on machine learning methods and applications for high-impact meteorological phenomena. Topics include AI-enhanced numerical weather prediction, uncertainty quantification, and applications for emergency response.  
The final day (morning) will synthesize findings and make contact with practitioners in France and Corsica.

### ðŸ”¥ **Key Topics:**
- Fire propagation modeling and fire-atmosphere coupling
- AI applications for wildfire and extreme weather events prediction   
- AI  methods for weather forecasting and downscaling  
- Data-driven applications for renewable energy production
- AI  approaches for wildfire data assimilation  
- Uncertainty quantification and ensemble forecasting for wildfires  
- Real-time monitoring and prediction systems  
- Risk analysis and hazard mapping  
- Operational decision support systems for emergency response  
- Wildfire resilience strategies for urban and peri-urban environments
