**Numerical Wildfire and AI Weather** is a small, high-level scientific workshop bringing together leading experts in weather AI, numerical wildfire forecasting, and fire-atmosphere interactions. The workshop is designed as an **intensive, on-site event**. Unlike large conferences, this **small-group format** allows for extended scientific exchanges, joint project work, and a strong interdisciplinary approach. The goal is to bridge the gap between cutting-edge research and operational needs by focusing on **real-world applications of AI, numerical modeling, and risk assessment**.


The first two days will focus on **wildfire science**, exploring fire-atmosphere interactions, numerical fire spread models, and operational forecasting challenges. Experts will discuss the latest advancements in **fire behavior prediction, risk assessment, and real-time monitoring**.


The next two days will shift towards **AI-driven forecasting of extreme weather events**, with sessions on machine learning methods and applications for high-impact meteorological phenomena. Topics include AI-enhanced numerical weather prediction, uncertainty quantification, and applications for emergency response.  
The final day (morning) will synthesize findings and make contact with practitioners in France and Corsica.

### ðŸ”¥ **Key Topics:**
- Coupling fire dynamics with high-resolution weather models  
- AI-driven forecasting for wildfire behavior and extreme weather events  
- Physics-based and data-driven fire propagation models  
- Risk analysis and hazard mapping for fire-prone regions
