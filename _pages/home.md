# Numerical Wildfire and AI Weather 2025

## Workshop : 03/11/2025 - 07/11/2025

##  [Institut d’Études scientifiques de Cargèse](https://iesc.universita.corsica/?lang=en){:target="_blank"} ,  Corsica, France

The Numerical Wildfire 2021 workshop is specifically focused on large wildfire events and extreme weather events, gathering scientists to synthesize approaches that can provide pragmatic answers to current problems with tools that can be made available rapidly- i.e. within 1-2 years - to decision makers.
The [previous edition](https://firecaster.universita.corsica/article/numerical-wildfire-2021/36/0/0/0/3435/fr) was held in November 2021.

Mornings will start by a plenary session acting as an introduction for the following talks. Some topics that will be covered are:

- Wildfire dynamics and coupled fire-atmosphere models

- Numerical models and experimental data

- Artificial intelligence and risk forecasts

In the afternoons, 30 minutes talks will be given on the topic introduced in the morning. Large break times are organized
